                <h4> Janssens, 2016, The art of ethics in the information society, Roeser, How art can contribute 
                    to the ethical reflect on risky technologies.</h4>

                    In this blog post, I’ll be discussing the reading from Janssens, L. (ed.) (2016) The art of ethics in 
                    the information society. Here Janssens aims at discussing new forms of art heavily influenced by technology, 
                    in an attempt to challenge the imagination, aid in the experiences of new scenarios, and broaden narrow 
                    perspectives through empathy, sympathy, and compassion (Janssens, 2016). The type of art focused on by Janssens 
                    are involved in the use of risky technologies, known as ‘techno-art’. 
                
                <h5>Techno-Art?</h5>

                This relates to the risk in the role that emotions might play in the ethical reflection triggered by works of techno-art. 
                As well as how the use of techno-art can then affect society.
                
                <div class="Quote">
                    “This is what I call ’techno-art’: art that reflects on and engages with risky technologies” (Janssens, 2016). 
                </div>

                There are many types of artists who are exploring the possibilities of their artwork being involved in risky technologies. 
                Techno-art has many possibilities for us, allowing us to be able to make abstract problems more concrete, they allow for 
                the use of new material possibilities as well as opening a whole new area of topics to engage with.  An example can be in 
                tackling climate change, the works of techno-art can depict how certain strategies can help combat climate change, or even 
                make viewers aware of how climate change will affect the world years down the like by making it more real, to inciting 
                people into taking action. 

                <div class="Quote">
                    “Techno-artists can go beyond the limitations of the labs of scientists and technology developers. They can take 
                    technologies to greater extremes and explore different scenarios in more tangible ways, and their works can be more 
                    accessible to society” (Janssens, 2016).
                </div>

                However, techno-art is able to influence people in very specific ways as it focuses on emotions as well as the imagination, 
                making the possibilities that can be depicted quite daunting. It can be endless to the type of hypothetical scenarios that 
                could be exposed to society in techno-art. The risk is in the role that emotions might play in the ethical reflection 
                triggered by works of techno-art. As well as how the use of techno-art can then affect society. 

                <div class="Quote">
                    “Techno-artworks can reach out to people in a very direct way, by drawing on their imaginative and emotional capacities. 
                    Works of techno-art provide for concrete, vivid images and narratives that make technological developments and their 
                    possible impact on society more tangible for a larger audience than is possible via highly specialised scientific 
                    articles and abstract philosophical theorising” (Janssens, 2016).
                </div>

                Therefore, it brings into question that of the ethics behind developing techno-art, Artists need to have a balance of 
                freedom in their art-work creations, yet at the same time artists need to be making meaningful contributions, ethically 
                doing justice to the legal constraints as well. Overall it should be understood that this type of technology can affect 
                society in many ways and artists need to be aware and understand the risks of their creations in techno-art. 

                <br></br>
                In conclusion, this blog discusses the reading from Janssens, L. (2016) ‘The art of ethics in the information society.’ 
                As well as unpacking techno-art and the many influences it can have on society. Overall, I believe that techno-art must 
                be deeply explored as well as set up with the correct ethical regulations as to prevent any damage to society. In the 
                right hand’s techno-art could make many situations tangible and allow us to be able to explore situations beyond our 
                imagination.
