                <h4>Close reading and reflection on Freedom and Data Profiling from Janssens, L. (ed.)
                     (2016) The art of ethics in the information society.</h4>

                     In this reading, Janssens discusses freedom and data profiling to determine if people are to be categorized 
                     in their behaviour or thoughts based on their data profiling, or is there more to it. Data profiling is creating 
                     algorithms based on you to profile your likes, dislikes, and who you are within the internet. However, Janssens 
                     questions whether humans have more too them than whatever can be categorized through data profiling.

                     <div class="Quote">
                        “In data profiling, however, lies the risk that human beings will only be seen through concepts which 
                        follow from a system that is guided by probability analyses.” (Janssens, 2016)
                     </div>

                     <h5>Big Data Profiling:</h5>

                     Data profiles are put together by studying many aspects that make you, you. This can be involved in what is in your 
                     DNA analyzing where your health will be withing the next few years. However, the predictions of these data profiles 
                     are not always correct, as we as humans grow and change within society, we come across certain factors that change 
                     our lives or impact these big data profiles.  Janssens speculates that with these big data profiles society can 
                     follow a path similar to movies like Gattaca. That if we were to rely on data profiling it could impact our 
                     freedom in our society as it impacts societal views of where a person belongs within society. 

                     <h5>Man as a predetermined being</h5>

                     <div class="Quote">
                        “The technological developments described above, which can provide a probability analysis of for example 
                        someone’s medical condition or even predict someone’s thoughts and (future) behaviour, creating the impression 
                        that the world of mystery is slowly fading away” (Janssens, 2016).
                     </div>

                     Janssens debates the possibility of our future becoming heavily reliant on data profiling within society and states 
                     the problematic elements that can arise through this. The problem with data profiling is that sometimes incorrect 
                     data can be formulated causing results of an invalid conclusion that does not align with reality (Janssens, 2016). 
                     This can lead to people changing their lives or listening to data and statistics that are not exactly true. There 
                     is a concern that these big data profiles will resort us, humans, into becoming more so objects with many 
                     characteristics and losing the layers that we as humans have to offer and counter as we go about our lives. 
                     Therefore, we need to be aware that these issues can arise and provide a counterweight whereby these issues can be 
                     noticed. 

                     <h5>Ethical implications</h5>

                     The ethical standpoint on big data profiling is a tricky one as humans create values and ethics as well as provide 
                     the data collections for big data profiles. One of the biggest values of man is that of freedom, yet big data 
                     profiling challenges the idea of freedom as it deconstructs the possibilities of our future and taking from the 
                     randomness of life. Therefore in order to continue doing both paths, Janssens suggests that we need to take a look 
                     and redefine our meaning of freedom and the possible implications this data has against us as a society.
