                <h4> Close reading and reflection on one of the selected essays from Riche, N. H. et al. (eds) (2018) Data-driven
                    storytelling.</h4>

                        “Communicating data in an effective and efficient story requires the content author to recognize the needs, 
                        goals, and knowledge of the intended audience” (Riche et al. 2018).
                    </div>

                    This blog post I’ll be looking at data-driven storytelling and communicating data to the audience. 
                    This relates to what we as designers do to help communicate to our audience, what we want and don’t what them to 
                    see and know. As well as who are we communicating data to, what does the audience know and not know. All these 
                    aspects are important as it helps us as designers understand our audience’s expectations and help us create and 
                    communicate data effectively. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Data Visualization is a powerful way of representing data and allows for information to be depicted visually in order 
                    for it to be understood easily by the audience. However, we need to know and understand our target audience and who 
                    are we creating this data for, as each member of the audience has different expectations and goals and comes from 
                    different cultures and backgrounds. 

                    <div class="Quote">
                        “Communicating data in an effective and efficient story requires the content author to recognize the needs, goals, 
                        and knowledge of the intended audience” (Riche et al. 2018).
                    </div>

                    Therefore, in order to effectively communicate ideas, concepts, and data the designer of the content needs to carefully 
                    think about how the work they produce will best fit the audience it is intended for. 

                    <div class="Quote">
                        “Like any other designed experience, data stories are more impactful and useful when they are crafted with the motivations, 
                        goals, and tasks of users in mind—in this case, the audience for the story” (Riche et al. 2018).
                    </div>

                    Another factor to look at is the design expectations, this relates to what the audience expects from the creator. One of 
                    the ways this can be focused on is in the consistency of the designer’s work. This can relate to the colour choices, fonts, 
                    layouts, and the type of interactivity that allows for the audience to associate that work with the designer and understand 
                    the type of content that they will be getting from this specific designer (Riche et al. 2018).An example can be The New York 
                    Times many people across the world purchase their newspapers due to their consistent information on current events and the 
                    familiar layout of the paper. The audience knows the quality of the type of information they are getting when they purchase 
                    a newspaper 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Another way to help improve the reception of data among the audience is to increase interactivity and allow the audience 
                    to directly engage with the data. 

                    <div class="Quote">
                        “It showed that asking participants to reflect on their prior knowledge by guessing numbers or explaining them helped 
                        readers with both comprehension and memory of the data” (Riche et al. 2018).
                    </div>

                    An example of this could be asking the audience how high they think the rate of teenagers dropping out of school is and 
                    then showing them the actual data. This allows the audience to remember the data as well as encourages engagement.
                    <br>
                    In conclusion, this blog post has discussed ways that designers can go about in order to create data more tailored to 
                    their audience. By having a consistent work style and effectively understanding and engagement with the audience it 
                    allows for data-driven storytelling to be an effective way of communicating data.
