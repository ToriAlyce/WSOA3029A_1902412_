                <h4>A reflection on my interactive data driven artwork</h4>

                    In this blog post, I will reflect on the interactive data-driven artwork I have created using D3. 
                    By discussing the data-driven artwork I have created, the interactivity, and the creation of the meaning of my 
                    artwork. As well as relating it to Kidd (2015) and his theory of representation. 

                    <br>
                    When it comes to understanding large amounts of data and statistics, data visualization is a very useful and 
                    important tool we are able to utilize in order to create meaning and understanding of the data represented. 
                    There are many ways that we are able to represent data visually from charts to graphs, to interactive data sets, 
                    the main point of creating these visualizations is to take the bland straight forward data and depict it in a new 
                    and interesting way that provides readability and meaning to the person viewing the data. 

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In creating my exam data-driven artwork, the data I wanted to represent focuses on the difference in population 
                    in South African provinces from 2019 to 2020 in relation to the population who are currently infected with the 
                    Corona Virus. In order to visually represent this data, I created a bubble map whereby I overlap the bubbles of 
                    data depicting the population size in 2019, 2020, and the currently infected population for each province. The 
                    reason I chose to visualize my data in this way is that by overlapping the bubbles it shows a clear indication 
                    of the comparison between the years as well as how much of our population is currently infected with the Corona 
                    Virus. Then to further enhance the data I created interactivity for the viewer of my visualization, by adding 
                    checkboxes that the user can tick on and off to display the data, this interactivity allows the user to see for 
                    themselves the comparison between the bubbles of data.

                    <br>
                    I am happy with my data-driven artwork as I believe it puts into perspective the total population of people who 
                    currently are infected with the Corona Virus, in comparison to the population size. When looking at the comparison 
                    it shows how small the population of infected is to the population size, providing hope that we can overcome this 
                    virus. However, due to the virus being so contagious even if there is such a small percentage of infected people it 
                    can still spread easily and quickly. Thus, the created meaning of my data aims to show that if we all follow the 
                    right procedures of wearing a mask, sanitizing and washing our hands, and maintain social distancing we can counteract 
                    the numbers and reduce the spread of the virus. This is the kind of visual communication I am trying to portray with 
                    my data, however, since visual communication relies so heavily on the viewer's interpretation of the data it is 
                    impossible for everyone who views my given data to deduce the same meaning. Therefore even though my hopes are for 
                    the people who view my data are to understand that we have a fighting chance against the virus if we act with caution, 
                    that does not mean that everyone will derive the same meaning. 
                    
                <div class="Quote">
                    “Visual communication can be understood as more ambiguous, suggestive, and open to multiple interpretations than 
                    other forms of communication, not least because the codes that are utilized remain unspoken, are not pinned down in 
                    language, and are nontextual.” (Kidd. J, 2015)
                </div>
                
                 Therefore, in relation to Kidd’s discussion on theories of representation, I have learned when creating my data-driven
                 artwork that the data being represented can be understood in many different ways to each person. In terms of my data,
                 the representation I am trying to show may not come across the same to another person who has had a different experience
                 of the pandemic. Thus, meaning created through my data will vary between people due to different cultures, experiences,
                 and understandings. 

                 <div class="Quote">
                    “We are reminded again that representations are constructive; they frame and feed into our understandings of the world 
                    and our place within it.” (Kidd. J, 2015)
                 </div>

                 Overall, I am happy with the data I have represented. However, In order to improve on this data representation, I would 
                 have liked to be able to add a tooltip that when the viewer's mouse hovers over each of the bubbles it would provide them 
                 with the name and the number of data being represented in that bubble. As well as being able to label each of the 
                 provinces in order to clearly depict the data.
