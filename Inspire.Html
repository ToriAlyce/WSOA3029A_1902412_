                    These two videos are both by an incredible artist called Ten Hundred. He is so creative, inspiring, productive with his 
                    artworks and all-around cool dude. He is an amazing colour artist so I thought he should be featured in my colour 
                    themed website. I picked these two videos as he shows in both how he can make money as an artist as well as his creative 
                    skill and as I am going into the creative industry its interesting to see people in similar professions and how they work. 
                    Hope he can inspire you to!
