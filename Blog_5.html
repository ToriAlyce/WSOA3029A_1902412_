                 In this blog post, I will be looking at the Best in Show: The Ultimate Data Dog, on the information is beautiful 
                    site. The data in this chart shows the supposedly best dog out of all the breeds, using data about each individual 
                    breed. Many aspects are taken into consideration such as intelligence, costs, longevity, grooming, ailments, and 
                    appetite. Overall, the data in this chart is depicted clearly and is easy to read and understand. The creators have 
                    achieved beautiful data representation with the use of data visualisation in order to make a overall beautiful and 
                    easy to read chart. 
                    All these aspects under consideration this type of data reminds me of the big data profiling discussed by Janssens.
                
                <div class="Quote">
                    “The technological developments described above, which can provide a probability analysis of for example someone’s 
                    medical condition or even predict someone’s thoughts and (future) behavior, creating the impression that the world 
                    of mystery is slowly fading away” (Janssens, 2016).
                </div>

                This is the type of data that has been depicted for the different dog breeds. Based on this data, data profiling was 
                able to happen and calculate “who is best in show”. In terms of this, I am not fond of this kind of data as I feel as 
                though it subtracts from the randomness of life, as everything appears to be already mapped out based on analytics. I 
                also believe that it can ethically affect the way that people would view and interact with these certain dog breeds, 
                as with all the data depicted about them, conceptions and fixed ideas based on this data will change how people 
                interact with the breeds. This would be the same for big data profiling with humans.

                <div class="Quote">
                    “The largely invisible hyperconnectivity of data flows and the probability analyses that are associated with 
                    this technology could change our conceptions and our encounter with the other as a fellow human being.” (Janssens, 2016).
                </div>

                The ethical standpoint on this type of data profiling is complex, as many types of opinions can be influenced based on 
                data presented. Ethically, this example of dog breeds might not be as serious and can be informative for most 
                people. However, I do believe that if this type of data and data profiling was applied to humans it could be 
                damaging to society. Therefore, ethical Implications must always be well considered.
