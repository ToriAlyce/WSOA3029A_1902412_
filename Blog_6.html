                <h4> Critical reflection on Interactive data visualisation tying it to theories of representation, 
                    data visualisation techniques and theories of interactivity.</h4>

                    For my interactive data visualisation, I used the help of D3.Js in order to make a circular packing map. 
                    I did not code this map but edited some of the aspects of it. Overall, this was a very creatively influenced 
                    type of interactivity through data visualisation. I used the graph in terms of representation and connotation 
                    in order to set up a proposed idea of how I would want the user to view this data with a theme of mental health.

                    <br>
                    The circles depicted by the graph represent the problems and worries we face in our day to day lives. The big red 
                    circles in the center, I like to think of as the person among all the problems. In order to get this point across 
                    the user can interact with the map and move any of the circles by dragging them around. If the user drags one of 
                    the big circles around, they are able to push and move the other smaller circles. By using the big red circle to 
                    move and push the other circles around, this a representation of how we have the ability to deal with our problems 
                    and face them. As the user pushes these problems, they can eventually push them out of view therefore showing that 
                    we can make our problems disappear we just need to interact and face them head-on. 

                    <br>

                    As my website aims at creating a space that inspires the viewers and encourages self-care and mental health, 
                    I believe this is a creatively appropriate use of data visualisation. Interactivity was the key element focused 
                    on in my interactive data visualisation as I felt as though the physical act of being able to interact with a 
                    problem would be able to make it seem more personal. 

                <div class="Quote">
                    “Visual communication can be understood as more ambiguous, suggestive, and open to multiple interpretations than 
                    other forms of communication, not least because the codes that are utilized remain unspoken, are not pinned down in 
                    language, and are nontextual.” (Kidd. J, 2015)
                </div>
                
                Allowing this graph to be more visually communitive would be by adding more interactivity. This type of interactive 
                element that I would like to implement into the graph would be that the user would be able to click on the circles and 
                name them according to the problems they have such as stress, exams, paying rent. This would allow them to create a 
                release and sort out the problems that they have in a more physical space and be interpreted in any way by the viewer. 
                This would also relate more to visual communicating as now the user would be able to see the problems they face being 
                depicted in this graph. Through the use of creative representation and data visualisation, I was able to make this an 
                interesting kind of data depiction that includes interactivity.
