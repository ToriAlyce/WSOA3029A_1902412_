                <h4> A close reading and reflection on the ‘Selected passage’ 
                    from Kidd, J. (2015) Theories of representation.</h4>

                This post will discuss Kidd’s work on representation, as he discusses different ways representation 
                affects the world that we live in. This is such, in terms of representation of the signified and 
                signifier; representation and myth; representation and visual communication; and lastly, representation 
                as persuasion.
                
                <h5>Representation of the signified and signifier:</h5>

                The first aspect of representation brought forward by Kidd involves semiotics. Semiotics is the study of 
                signs and their meanings or representations. Signs can have many meanings but are mostly built to depict 
                one specific thing, like road signs. However, based on a person’s social and cultural background, a sign 
                can be interpreted in many ways, thus having many different meanings. The basis around semiotics involves 
                signified and signifier. The signified is based on what is understood from the sign’s depiction. Whereas 
                the signifier is what has been depicted, the form of the sign. Although these can change as they are dependent 
                on the social and cultural context of the viewer (Kidd. J, 2015) 
                By understanding semiotics we are able to understand how representation if formed off of them, thus allowing us 
                to uncover many possibilities that a sign’s meaning can hold and represent for another person.

                <h5>Representation and myth:</h5>

                Sings have many different meanings and it is the denotations and connotations of the signs that provide meaning, 
                the semiotician Roland Barthes began to shed light on this subject. 
                
                <div class="Quote">
                    “He was interested in the relationship between what is seen, and what is understood at the level of myth; in the 
                    distinction between what he called the denotations and the connotations in a text (1957)” (Kidd. J, 2015).
                </div>

                Denotations refer to what is visually being depicted, referring to the apple logo, for example, the denotation here is 
                that it is an image of an apple with a bite out of it. Whereas the connotation refers to the meanings brought forward 
                by that depiction, in terms of Apple this relates to whatever meaning is connotated about the product. Some believe 
                Apple products to be high-end tech, whereas others believe that they are overpriced. However, Barthes explains that 
                it is more complicated, some connotations we have of things have been enforced onto us by the media and their connotations 
                become myths that we believe to be true. 

                <div class="Quote">
                    “Barthes called this phenomenon, the bringing together of signs and their connotations, the making of 
                    ‘myth’ (1957)”       (Kidd. J, 2015).
                </div>

                Barthes claims that many specific symbols have been given connotations that are so powerful and popular within 
                the media that they exceed their connotations and become myths. This is due to the many believes into their 
                connotation, that people believe it to be fact. There are so many of these mythical connotations that have been 
                boosted through the media that we as viewers no longer can detect them anymore.

                <h5>Representation and visual communication:</h5>

                Visual communication is harder to construct in terms of representation. An image can say a thousand words as everything 
                depicted in an image can have its own representational meaning. Sometimes the meaning is derived from whatever the 
                audience believes it to be and this can vary as people with different cultures and life experiences will see and construct 
                different representations from one another. 

                <div class="Quote">
                    “Visual communication can be understood as more ambiguous, suggestive, and open to multiple interpretations 
                    than other forms of communication, not least because the codes that are utilized remain unspoken, are not 
                    pinned down in language, and are nontextual” (Kidd. J, 2015).
                </div>

                When producing and viewing images and involving visual communication it is important to understand five main elements 
                that should be considered to help interpret the image. Firstly, images presentational context, referring to the form 
                the image appears in a portrait for example. Secondly, an image production context, relating to the origins of where 
                the image was created and who produced it. Third, the historical context, the time period it was created in, and the 
                cultural factors within that time period. Forth, is the images context of other images, is the image depicted with many 
                other images or a text perhaps? Lastly, is the context of reception the understanding drawn from an image will differ 
                based on a person’s perspective, what we are thinking and feeling or who we are with when viewing an image can change 
                the meaning we derive. 

                <h5>Representation as persuasion:</h5>

                Representation has the ability to be able to persuade people, this is related in terms of advertising. Kidd discusses 
                that representations are built and constructed in certain ways to control the market and its viewers by forcing opinions 
                in an attempt to persuade the target audience to take their advertisements preferred meaning and believe it to be true. 
                This can be done in many ways; an example could be that these specific tablets will make anyone lose weight and achieve 
                their summer body goals. They say that it is possible, the consumer just needs to take the tablets, but this is not 
                necessarily true as everyone’s body is different, and results can differ. The main goal of representation as persuasion 
                is to get the audience to believe in something that might not necessarily be true and can be a very dangerous form of 
                representation.

                In conclusion, in this blog post we have looked at the various forms of representation discussed by Kidd, in terms of 
                representation of the signified and signifier; representation and myth; representation and visual communication; and lastly, 
                representation as persuasion. As well as discussing how each form affects society and our beliefs.
